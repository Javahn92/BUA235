		<p align="left">
		I am currently a senior at the University of Maine, earning a B.S in Finance.Originally I had attended the university 
		to study Mechanical Engineering, which I spent three years pursuing. After taking a handful of business courses, with 
		the intention of earning an MBA with my engineering degree, I discovered my passion for tracking and analyzing financial 
		markets and investment vehicles. My complete course history can be viewed in this site for those who are curious.

		Most of my vacation time has been spent traveling. In recent years I have visted South Korea, Japan, and the United Arab Emirates.
		I have found traveling to be the best teacher of life and the most fulfilling experience. In my website is also a list of places
		I have traveled to with links to videos that describe the country.
